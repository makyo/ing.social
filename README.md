Why was `ing.social` available?

Why does anyone let Maddy near domain name registrars?

Worry not, the answer lies here:

## ____.ing.social mastodon instances

There are a lot of general masto instances out there. Which is good!

There are also a lot of specific masto instances, too. This is also good.

Still, snagging an appropriate domain and setting up mastodon is a bit of work. That's where `ing.social` comes into play. [@makyo@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@makyo) grabbed this domain for specific-interest mastodon instances. Initially, she wanted `cook.ing.social`, but there are a lot of different uses for it. `writ.ing.social`? Heck yeah. `flirt.ing.social`? Why not! `fuck.ing.social`? Play safe!

Anyhow, Maddy's still thinking this through, but will update here once she's got a solid game plan. 

Until then, you can get in touch with her at [@makyo@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@makyo) or by email at <makyo@drab-makyo.com>
